The NAV_MODE defined the current flight state: LIFTOFF (often an open-loop maneuver), LANDING, WAYPOINTS or VECTOR. This represents the internal navigation state machine. The system status shows wether the system is currently active or not and if an emergency occured. During the CRITICAL and EMERGENCY states the MAV is still considered to be active, but should start emergency procedures autonomously.
